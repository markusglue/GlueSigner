# GlueSigner
Mobile Signing of PDF Documents with a SuisseID.

The SuisseID is an electronic identity card. It provides legal and technical requirements for digital transmissions. Owners of a SuisseID can securely authenticate to web applications and legally valid sign documents.
GlueSigner was a Bacheleor Thesis in 2014 supported by Glue Software Engineering AG. Glue Software Engineering AG already offers the Local Signer for signing PDF documents on a PC.
GlueSigner should enable the signing functionality for mobile devices running Android OS.
